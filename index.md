# About Me


<img src="/images/medrum1.png" class="floatpic">

Here is **Yiran Xu (Raizel, 徐一冉)**.<br>

I am a  junior studying Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by [Prof. Li Shang](https://cscw.fudan.edu.cn/lishang/list.htm). I am currently working on some amazing AI projects, which involve Smart earwear, ML and RL, trying to create a personal LLM deployed on a cell phone, which is challenging but cool.<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, feel free to reach out to me at my email.

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a PhD position for fall 2026. If you have any information, please contact me. Thank you!</font>**

Currently doing research in Fudan MemX lab. My research focuses on what a personal LLM with voice+text in and voice out can do for individual person, and I'm trying to make it not forgettable through MoE, while exploring what other interesting things it can do.
