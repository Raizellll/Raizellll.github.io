# About Me

<img src="/images/pld.jpg" class="floatpic">

Hi! I’m **Yiran Xu (Raizel, 徐一冉)** — a senior undergraduate majoring in Computer Science at **Fudan University**, advised by [Prof. Li Shang](https://cscw.fudan.edu.cn/lishang/list.htm).

My research centers on **large language models, interpretability, and algorithmic reasoning**. I am particularly interested in how internal modularity and activation dynamics give rise to reasoning, confidence, and creativity in neural systems.  
Previously, I worked with [**Prof. Robert Dick**](https://ece.engin.umich.edu/personnel/dick-robert) at the **University of Michigan**, studying *latent expert discovery* in pretrained Transformers, and I formerly worked in the **MemX Lab** at Fudan under Prof. Shang, exploring multimodal, memory-augmented LLM applications.  

At Fudan, under [**Prof. Yixin Cao**](https://www.caoyixin.site/), I am now conducting research on *Deep Evaluation via Neural Activation Analysis*, connecting architectural modularity with activation-level interpretability to better understand model reasoning and evaluation dynamics.  

If you share similar interests, feel free to reach out: **yiranxu22 at m.fudan.edu.cn**

> **🎯 I am currently seeking a PhD position for Fall 2026** in areas related to LLM interpretability, HCI, or algorithmic AI foundations. I would deeply appreciate any related information or opportunities.
