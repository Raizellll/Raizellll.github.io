# About Me


<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7603552c-c383-4894-99bc-f47011e6f970" class="floatpic">

Here is **Yiran Xu (Raizel, 徐一冉)**.<br>

I am a  junior studying Computer Science at Fudan University, supervised by [Prof. Li Shang](https://cscw.fudan.edu.cn/lishang/list.htm). I am currently working on some amazing AI projects, which involve Smart eyewear, ML and RL, trying to create a personal LLM deployed on a cell phone, which is challenging but cool.<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, feel free to reach out to me at my email.
