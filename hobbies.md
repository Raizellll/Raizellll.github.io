# Hobbies
Iâ€™m passionate about Drums, and I have organized a band, covering JPOP and JROCK music. In 2024, our band performed about 10 times in and out of school. Our motto is Eat well, Drink well, Go to bed early, Get up early. I also play badminton regularly and want to improve my strength. I enjoy my time with my cat mina. And I'm learning to plant.

<br>Swimming removes my worries, refreshes my body, and brings me courage to address any challenges. I extremely enjoy the feeling of being immersed in the water. Besides, I am a member of the Swimming Team at Fuzhou University, where I meet many sincere friends. I have reached **China National Second-level athlete Standard** in 50m breaststroke and won **Five Gold Medals** during my 15-year swimming career. Recently, I am also keen on surfing.
