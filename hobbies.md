# Hobbies
Iâ€™m passionate about Drums, and I have organized a band, covering JPOP and JROCK music. In 2024, our band performed about 10 times in and out of school. Our motto is Eat well, Drink well, Go to bed early, Get up early. I also play badminton regularly and want to improve my strength. I enjoy my time with my cat mina. And I'm learning to plant.
