## Ongoing Project

- Efficient and Personalized (Speech+Text)-to-Text Model for Edge Intelligence (Supervised by Dr. [Li Shang](https://cscw.fudan.edu.cn/lishang/list.htm))

To make LLM cheaper while serving people better, this project addresses the critical need for deploying sophisticated (speech+text)-to-text models on resource-constrained edge devices. We aim to design and implement an efficient and adaptable model capable of processing both speech and text inputs, while offering user-specific personalization and high-speed inference on devices such as smartphones. Our approach involves distilling a large speech language model into an Oracle Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, incorporating continuous learning mechanisms for user adaptation, and applying low-rank compression techniques for optimized performance. The ultimate goal is to enable high-performance, user-centric AI experiences directly at the edge, bringing intelligent and personalized communication to the forefront of the Internet of Everything.

## Early Project

- **Huawei Technologies**, Designed cognitive prompting pipeline with three-stage code generation: problem decomposition → iterative task execution (code generation/optimization) → termination criteria verification. Trained Qwen-2.5-72B model on TACO dataset (3,500 CodeForces problems) with 20-step reasoning trajectories.

- Exploring Zero-Shot classification capabilities of CLIP. Develop CLIPText for text classification and validated cross-domain robustness, optimizing training strategies to enhance feature discrimination

- Solution to the Francis Scott Key Bridge Collapse Impact and Baltimore Transit Optimization. Engineered a data-driven solution to mitigate Baltimore’s bridge collapse disruptions and redesign its bus network, prioritizing low-income access and system efficiency.
