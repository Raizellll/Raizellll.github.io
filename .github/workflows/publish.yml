## Manuscripts

### **Demand-Driven Modularity in Fine-Tuned Transformers**  
**Yiran Xu**, Robert P. Dick  
*Manuscript in preparation, targeting ICML 2026.*

A study of when and why modular structure emerges in Transformers.  
Through multi-task fine-tuning experiments (e.g., Math vs. Sentiment), we find that  
modularity does **not** arise from input distribution shifts but emerges only under  
**strong functional conflict**. We also show that optimization favors **shared low-rank  
subspaces**, and modularity is an **efficiency–accuracy tradeoff** rather than  
a natural property of the architecture.

## Technical Reports & Writing Samples

### **Activation Subspace Rubrics for Evaluating Long-Form Reasoning**  
*Technical report draft, 2025.*

An exploration of how **activation geometry** in LLMs can be mapped to  
interpretable rubrics for reasoning quality, process correctness, and creativity.  
We identify latent subspaces consistently correlated with “good reasoning” signals  
and validate them via causal interventions.
