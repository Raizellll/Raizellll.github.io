I am **Yiran Xu (徐一冉)**, a senior undergraduate in Computer Science at **Fudan University**.  
My research interests lie in **mechanistic interpretability**, **latent modularity in Transformers**, and **evaluation of long-form reasoning and creativity** in large language models.

I am currently working with **Prof. Yixin Cao** (Fudan University) and **Prof. Robert Dick** (University of Michigan) on:
- understanding how internal activations in LLMs give rise to expert-like submodules, and  
- using activation-space structure to evaluate reasoning quality beyond surface correctness.

I plan to apply for **PhD programs starting Fall 2026**.

- Mechanistic interpretability of Transformers and LLMs  
- Latent experts / subnetworks and modular reasoning  
- Evaluation of long-form reasoning and creativity (LongWriter / HelloBench / WritingBench)  
- Causal RL and self-consistent data generation for reasoning
