I am **Yiran Xu (徐一冉)**, a senior undergraduate in Computer Science at **Fudan University**.  
My work centers on understanding **how large language models internally organize computation**—  
specifically, *why* modular structures sometimes emerge, *when* they collapse into shared subspaces,  
and *how* activation geometry encodes reasoning quality.

I am advised by **Prof. Yixin Cao** (Fudan University) and **Prof. Robert Dick** (University of Michigan).  
Across both groups, I study:

- the mechanisms behind **latent experts**, modularity, and low-rank bottlenecks in Transformers  
- the use of **activation subspaces** to evaluate long-form reasoning, creativity, and process quality  
- how optimization dynamics (e.g., gradient flow, efficiency biases) shape representational structure  

I am applying to **PhD programs for Fall 2026**, aiming to build a principled understanding of  
**how reasoning is represented inside LLMs** and **how modularity can be encouraged or reliably induced**.

### Research interests

- Mechanistic interpretability of Transformers and LLMs  
- Latent modularity, functional conflict, and emergent experts  
- Representation structure: low-rank manifolds, subspaces, causal directions  
- Evaluation of long-form reasoning and creativity (LongWriter, HelloBench, WritingBench)  
- Causal RL and self-consistent data generation for reasoning tasks
